# The ordinal rank of the freeness tree

The rep-free finite subsets of a counterexample's basis form a tree
under extension-by-a-larger-element.  `free_prefixes_die_of_hfail`
says every branch dies; here that becomes a well-founded relation
(`freeStep_wf`) carrying an ordinal rank that every extension
strictly decreases (`exists_strict_rank`).

This is the formal centerpiece of the rank program
(docs/rank-program.md): the floods are the stalled nodes of this
tree, and a proof that some verified operation drives the rank down
past every ordinal would refute the counterexample outright.
