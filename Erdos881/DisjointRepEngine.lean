# Engine V10: the disjoint-representation engine

A new surviving-deletion engine with a hypothesis interface unlike the
family/identity engines V2–V9: *representation multiplicity growth*.

If for every `K` all sufficiently large `n` admit `K` pairwise-disjoint
3-representations (no shared part values between distinct
representations), then a sufficiently slowly-growing infinite deletion
`B ⊆ A` survives: any target `n` sees at most `K` members of `B` below
it while owning `K + 1` disjoint representations, and hitting all of
them would embed `K + 1` representations injectively into `K` markers —
pigeonhole.

Contrapositive interface for the counterexample: some fixed `K` bounds
the pairwise-disjoint 3-representation count on a cofinal set of
targets — a tangible additive-combinatorics rigidity the lab census
finds nowhere (every covering structure tested has unbounded
disjoint-rep growth; size-≤2 rep covers simply do not exist).
